==================

-2 : Problem 1 - in "addStrTo***" in case of "newListNode" failed, you should free the memory you already allocated for the string.

-2 : Problem 1 - in "addStrTo***" you should check whether "newListNode" does not return NULL.

-4 : Problem 1 - "freeStrList" does not work well. should free list and data, and strList.

-4 : Problem 1 - in "addStrToSortedList" should free the memory allocated by "listToArray" (and check whether does not return NULL)

-3 : Problem 1 - in "printStrList" , "strcmp(toPrint, toPrintCheck)" but "toPrintCheck" is uninitialized!

Good Luck in the exam! :)
