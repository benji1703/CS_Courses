-4 : Problem 2 - Wrong output - because you don't filter words as a sequence of letters in lower or upper case ([:alpha:]) flanked by white spaces or punctuation marks correctly (for example, how does your code treat the following : "abc123edf", "ijk321", "123ghi", etc.? [hint - they aren't words, and neither are part of them])

-2 : Problem 3.1 - Should print all subdirectories directly under that directory *with read access for all users*
